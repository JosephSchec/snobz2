## SNOBZ 2
Updating snobz with webpack and npm_modules, additionally loadoutput was replaced by a site I found online.

### - visit [Snobz2](snobz2.vercel.app)

Due to vercel not reading js files in seperate folder this repository may seem messy:
  * Index.html = template
  * Index.js = setting up the map
  * List.js = list icon clicks
  * About.js = about section
  * FeedBack.js = send feedback tab
