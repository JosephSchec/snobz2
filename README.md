## SNOBZ
After a 3 week break from class I have completed my first project . Welcome to Snobz where one can explore coffee shops around the globe. This site was previously built by my friend on App Sheet , where I then took it upon myself to make a faster cleaner looking site. Most of the (vanilla) JavaScript is self taught from google, as well as working with leafletjs API. Later on (after returning to class and learning) I hope to use more common conventions and clean up up the code but until then.... 

### - visit [Snobz](snobz.vercel.app)

Due to vercel not reading js files in seperate folder this repository may seem messy:
  * Index.html = template
  * Index.js = setting up the map
  * LoadOutput.js = parses csv file to json
  * List.js = list icon clicks
  * About.js = about section
  * FeedBack.js = send feedback tab
